I am an undergraduate student of BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. I study Computer Science here. I am a Machine Learning enthusiast pretty much since I read those words the first time.
Currently, I am a Google Summer of Code intern with R Project for Statistical Computing. I am also working on a project with the Cognitive Neuroscience folks, on home automation using EEG and visual identification of devices.
I always hope that my work contributes in making people's lives more comfortable, directly or indirectly. Hence, Open Source always gets me going.
I am an explorer by nature, so when I am not sitting in my chair hunched over a Mac,
I work out and travel the world. I believe that exploring anything new always brings out a new perspective and angle to living life.
